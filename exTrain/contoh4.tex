Computer networks have changed our lives. They grew slowly, and mostly unnoticed, in the 1970s and 1980s.\newline In the 1990s, though, something happened. Perhaps it was the availability of the \textbf{World Wide Web} (\textit{WWW, or Web}) and \textbf{graphical Web browsers}, which made computer networks accessible to Grandma Dorothy and Uncle Stan. \linebreak Maybe it was that the availability of network connections had reached a \underline{critical threshold}. Perhaps the quality and quantity of network-enabled software passed a critical threshold. Possibly it was two or all three of these things, or something else entirely. In any event, networks became noticeable. Most importantly, the Internet became noticeable.
